## Calypt0sis - The Masked Spirit
Invisible among the invisible, Calypt0sis is a mist drifting across networks, barely skimming the surface before disappearing. He has no face or form, only evanescent traces left in the codes. Those who cross his path never know whether they have been observed or manipulated. He redefines the rules of the invisible and rewrites the very fabric of the virtual.
